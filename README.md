# News-Wise - Omi Hackathon (Dec'24)

## Inspiration
In today's fast-paced information landscape, staying updated on topics of personal interest can be challenging. News wise is a tool to create a personalized, intelligent news aggregation that goes beyond traditional news readers. By using Omi, we aim to transform how users consume and interact with news content.

## What it does
News Wise is an intelligent news curation app that:

Retrieves real-time news across user-defined topics, Provides concise, objective summaries, Offers context and key insights, Adapts to user's evolving interests, Ensures information comes from credible sources

## How we built it
App is built using Omi memory prompt feature. The core mechanism relies on a carefully crafted prompt that instructs to act as a news aggregation assistant, with precise guidelines for retrieving, summarizing, and presenting news. When a user defines their topics of interest, the memory prompt triggers a comprehensive news retrieval process. It systematically searches for recent, credible articles, extracts key information, and generates concise summaries that capture the essence of each news story.

## Future Scope
The future of News wise will focus on robust multilingual capabilities, to focus on global news. The system will not just translate content, but intelligently contextualize foreign news, ensuring accurate interpretation of cultural nuances, maintaining the original news source's integrity, and providing verified translations from reputable international media outlets.
